# Web App Migration: Streamlit to Dash

By migrating to Dash, you now have a premium web experience natively built in Python. This is exactly what you want to showcase your data analytics pipeline skills—Dash is the industry standard for creating robust analytical web applications.

## Verification Proof

Here is a recording showing the app in action: using the sidebar, searching for an apple, logging data, and seeing the Plotly dashboard update in real-time.

And here is the final resulting sleek, glassmorphic dashboard running purely on Python and Dash components:

## What Changed

### Architecture Switch
We replaced Streamlit with `dash` and `dash-bootstrap-components` to achieve granular control over styling and layout logic without leaving Python.
- **[app_dash.py](file:///Users/pranavparthasarathy/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/fitness-tracker/app_dash.py)**: The new entry point. Configures standard Boostrap Darkly theme.
- **[assets/style.css](file:///Users/pranavparthasarathy/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/fitness-tracker/assets/style.css)**: Dash automatically serves CSS from the `assets` folder. We built a gorgeous CSS file focusing on glassmorphic elements, modern gradients, and hover transitions.

### 📊 Dashboard Page ([pages/dashboard.py](file:///Users/pranavparthasarathy/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/fitness-tracker/pages/dashboard.py))
We recreated the visual hierarchy using Plotly and Dash components.
- Now uses pure `dcc.Graph` elements integrated with Plotly's `plotly_dark` themes to match our exact background colors.
- Custom "metric cards" using Bootstrap layouts and tailored CSS classes.

### 📝 Logs Page ([pages/logs.py](file:///Users/pranavparthasarathy/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/fitness-tracker/pages/logs.py))
Centralized all data-entry forms into a robust grid using native Dash inputs and callbacks.
- **Unified Callbacks**: `Input()`, `Output()`, and `State()` handle writes to our [database.py](file:///Users/pranavparthasarathy/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/fitness-tracker/database.py) seamlessly without full page reloads.
- The [search_food](file:///Users/pranavparthasarathy/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/fitness-tracker/pages/logs.py#114-133) fallback logic we wrote previously is completely integrated!

## How to Run

Stop any existing Streamlit logs, then run:

```bash
python app_dash.py
```

The app will instantly be available locally at `http://127.0.0.1:8050`.

> [!TIP]
> This pipeline structure perfectly mimics industry data science dashboards. You now have the full control to tweak the HTML layout structure, add complex chart interactions, and style everything precisely—something that is notoriously difficult in base Streamlit!
